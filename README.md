Airline project

What factors explain the difference in price between an economy ticket and a premium-economy airline ticket?

Premium Economy is found mostly on international flights and, compared to standard Economy, offers about 5-7 inches of extra legroom as 
well as additional amenities, which can include: 1-2 extra inches of seat width. 2-3 extra inches of seat recline. Adjustable headrests, 
legrests, or lumbar support.

10 Quick Hints
Read the data into R
Summarize the data to understand the mean, median, standard deviation of  each variable
Draw Box Plots / Bar Plots to visualize the distribution of each variable independently
Draw Scatter Plots to understand how are the variables correlated pair-wise
Draw a Corrgram; Create a Variance-Covariance Matrix
Articulate a Hypothesis (or two) that you could test using a Regression Model
Run T-Tests appropriate, to test your Hypotheses
Formulate a Regression Model:  
y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ..
Think about what should ‘y’ be?
Think about what could x = {x1, x2, ..} be?
Fit a Linear Regression Model using lm()
Use this model results to test your Hypotheses and draw inferences
